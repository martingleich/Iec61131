Use popsicle tree and add file to source position
Add find expression at source position
Add find bound expression at source position
Initial values:
	Constant values for FunctionBlock-VAR, VAR_STRUCT, PROGRAM-VAR.
		This must happen in a seperate pass after types are resolved
	Bound expression for VAR_TEMP-Var.

Add initializers
Simple incremental compile
Add bound node types for symbols, this would give a working space for the multiple compile-phases and allow a details lookup.

	Add casts:

	Add scalar operations:
		(L)TIME * ANY_NUM -> (L)TIME
		(L)TIME / ANY_NUM -> (L)TIME
		(L)TIME / (L)TIME -> (L)REAL
		(L)TIME MOD (L)TIME -> (L)TIME
