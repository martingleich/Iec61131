Language-features:
	Do not invoke constant folding for non-compiling expressions.
	Do not generate casts for binary operations that contain a literal.
		DINT + 1 -> DINT + DINT#1
		For literals perform partial typification. i.e. 1 becomes ANY_INT_AT_LEAST_SINT, etc.
		All otherexpressions are typed with the expression typifier.
		Then perform type inference for the generics.
		Then make sure everything is typified.
	Allow more constants in GVL initial values.
	Add CASE statement
	Add Exception System
	Add safe ENUMs
	Add constant condition handling to flow analysis
	Add call output and call return value var decls.
	Strings
	Durations
		Add casts:
			TIME->LTIME
		Add scalar operations:
			(L)TIME * ANY_NUM -> (L)TIME
			(L)TIME / ANY_NUM -> (L)TIME
			(L)TIME / (L)TIME -> (L)REAL
			(L)TIME MOD (L)TIME -> (L)TIME

VsCode:
	DAP-Implementation
		Create debug features:
			Breakpoints
				Add breakpoints for initial values.
				Add breakpoints for for loop.
				Support breakpoints from debugger.
			Monitoring:
				Structures
	LSP-Implementation

CodeGenIR:

Compiler-features:
	Store scopes with symbols:
		The scope contains only variables with differing names.
		The scope is used with symbol sets to ensure uniqueness.
	Add find expression at source span
	Add find bound expression at source span
	Simple incremental compile
	Add bound node types for symbols, this would give a working space for the multiple compile-phases and allow a details lookup.
	LateLanguageUpdates

	More Boundnodes:
		Boundnode for FOR-Loop-Vardecl.
		Boundnode for Qualified-Variable.
		Boundnode for Qualified-Type.

	Syntaxlowering:
		Make bound nodes able to be generated by hand.
