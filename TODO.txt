Language-features:
	Add CASE statement
	Add Exception System
	Add safe ENUMs
	Add constant condition handling to flow analysis
	Add call output and call return value var decls.
	Strings
	Durations
		Add casts:
			TIME->LTIME
		Add scalar operations:
			(L)TIME * ANY_NUM -> (L)TIME
			(L)TIME / ANY_NUM -> (L)TIME
			(L)TIME / (L)TIME -> (L)REAL
			(L)TIME MOD (L)TIME -> (L)TIME

VsCode:
	DAP-Implementation
		Install dap mock
	LSP-Implementation


Compiler-features:
	Store scopes with symbols:
		The scope contains only variables with differing names.
		The scope is used with symbol sets to ensure uniqueness.
	Add find expression at source span
	Add find bound expression at source span
	Simple incremental compile
	Add bound node types for symbols, this would give a working space for the multiple compile-phases and allow a details lookup.
	LateLanguageUpdates

	More Boundnodes:
		Boundnode for FOR-Loop-Vardecl.
		Boundnode for Qualified-Variable.
		Boundnode for Qualified-Type.

	Syntaxlowering:
		Make bound nodes able to be generated by hand.
